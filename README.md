# AI Calendar & Email Assistant
An AI-powered n8n agent that drafts emails and creates Google Calendar events directly from chat requests.

This project is an end-to-end AI agent built with n8n that performs two main tasks:
1. Drafts emails based on user prompts.
2. Creates Google Calendar events with title, attendees, description, and correct time formatting.

The agent is triggered through a chat interface and uses configured tools (Gmail + Google Calendar) to automate communication and scheduling. The workflow handles natural-language requests, generates accurate event data, and prepares ready-to-send email drafts.

This repository contains the workflow configuration, prompt logic, and setup instructions for running the agent end-to-end.
